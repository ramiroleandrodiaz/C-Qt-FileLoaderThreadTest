File Loader Thread Comparison QT-C++

This project lets the user understand the difference between using one simple thread vs using a dedicated thread to load a file.

In this case, the loader method creates a big 3D matrix from the selected file and updates the GUI (loaded percentage).

The filetype is a private file format used for research in a project I've worked in.
